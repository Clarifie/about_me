## Example designs
### Menu
![Main menu design, 2 out of 4 logos made inside of a rounded square](designs/CiteDesign2_Initial.png)
![Main menu design dark mode, same as above](designs/CiteDesign2_Page.png)

### Text
![Main text view, the square menu to the left side with boxes of expandable text to the right](designs/CiteDesign2_Text.png)
The boxes will hold titles which can be expanded into full bits of text, these can
hold details about projects or things about me. You can scroll through this "window"
and the boxes will come into view, the circle with arrows on the side of the menu
shows how far has been scrolled and should be draggable.

### Images
![Main image view, the square menu to the left side and images that rotate downward](designs/CiteDesign2_Main.png)
The boxes here are images which you can scroll through and they rotate into full
view. They should be clickable to expand them. Similar to the text design the circle
on the right of the menu can scroll through the images like a timeline.
